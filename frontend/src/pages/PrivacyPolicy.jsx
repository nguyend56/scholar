        <p>
          In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and
          administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud
          prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your

        <h2 id="3">
          3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in
          this section and/or with the following third parties. We may need to
          share your personal information in the following situations: Business

          accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing
          legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
          either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
          possible (for example, because your personal information has been
          stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
          information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible.

        <h2 id="5">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p>
          In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system
          of organizational and technical security measures. We have implemented
          appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
          we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
          information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
          information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
          we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
          unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
          improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
          transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
          your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure

          unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
          right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK

          "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. However, please
          note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before

        <h2 id="7">7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice.

        <h2 id="8">8. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p>
          In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
          specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
          California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The

          parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of
          all third parties with which we shared personal information in the
          immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident
          and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
          writing to us using the contact information provided below. If you are
          under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered
          account with Services, you have the right to request removal of
          unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request
          removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information
          provided below and include the email address associated with your
          account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make
          sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be
          aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed
          from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

          In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or
          delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a
          consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a
          consumer request. Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a
          Consumer’s Privacy Rights We will not discriminate against you if you
          exercise your privacy rights. Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of
          Sensitive Personal Information We do not process consumer's sensitive
          personal information. Verification process Upon receiving your
          request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the
          same person about whom we have the information in our system. These
          verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so
          that we can match it with information you have previously provided us.
          For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask
          you to provide certain information so that we can match the
          information you provide with the information we already have on file,
          or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
          email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
          verification methods as the circumstances dictate. We will only use
          personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
          or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will
          avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
          verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
          information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
          additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and
          for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
          additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
